# System Microservices
> :computer: A collection of microservices for fetching host information.

These are a collection of tiny web applications powered by [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro). I
created them primarily for practice setting up reverse proxies like Nginx and HAProxy; cloud load
balancers; service discovery with Consul; and container orchestration with Docker Swarm and
Kubernetes.

All services provide the hostname and IP address, so you can determine which host you were load
balanced to when running in a distributed environment.

Morgan is used for logging to `stdout`.
